<h1 align="center">Maze solver or pathfinding algorithm</h1>
<p align="center">This repository contains the implementation and visualization of the primitive pathfinding algorithm.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Given a space with passages and walls, an entry point and an exit point are also given, you must find a path from start to finish through free cells. We can divide this task into 2 subtasks:
  <ol>
    <li>Generate given space (maze)</li>
    <li>Implement a pathfinding algorithm</li>
    <li>Create visualization of this algorithm</li>
  </ol>
</p>
